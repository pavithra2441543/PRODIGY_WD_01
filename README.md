# PBfashions - Enhanced Navigation

This project implements a simple website for "PBfashions" with a focus on an enhanced navigation bar that includes a scroll effect and a dropdown menu.

## Files Included

* **index.html:** The main HTML file that structures the website's content, including the navigation bar, hero section, content cards, and footer.
* **style.css:** The CSS file that provides the styling for the website, including the navigation bar, hero section, content layout, and overall visual appearance. It also handles the scroll effect and dropdown menu styles.
* **script.js:** The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the navigation bar. It implements the scroll effect that changes the navbar's background color when the user scrolls down the page.

## Features

* **Fixed Navigation Bar:** The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls.
* **Scroll Effect:** The navigation bar's background color changes when the user scrolls down past a certain point.
* **Dropdown Menu:** The "Services" menu item has a dropdown menu with links to "Web Design," "SEO," and "Consulting."
* **Hero Section:** A prominent hero section with a background image, title, and tagline.
* **Content Cards:** Two content cards providing information about "About Us" and "Our Services."
* **Responsive Design:** The CSS includes basic styling to make the layout adaptable to different screen sizes (implied by the viewport meta tag, though more detailed responsiveness might be needed).
